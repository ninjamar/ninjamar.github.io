      <p>I've decided to make a kernel. I'm going to call it ninjamar's kernel or nmk for short. I mostly plan to make it in C. <a href = "https://github.com/ninjamar/nmk">Here</a> is the github repository. The kernel will be non-gui or in the terminal. Please for view the README.md inside the repository for running instructions.</p>
